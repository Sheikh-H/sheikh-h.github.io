          <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
          <p>
            When it comes to testing the security flaws of a system, we might
            often think about a singular element, like a website or application
            that we would attempt to breach. The reality behind penetration
            testing is that there is a standard to follow. This
            protocol/standard outlines and details the following sections;
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reconnaisance</li>
            <li>Scanning</li>
            <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
            <li>Exploitation</li>
            <li>Post Exploit Reporting</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Each phase allows a penetration tester to gather and collect
            valuable insight and information throughout, which is then fed
            directly into the exploitation and reporting phases. There are also
            tools that are made specifically for each phase that allow hackers
            to navigate themselves correctly during the overall procedure.

            <br /><br />An unspoken requirement that's not often mentioned is
            using Kali Linux or Linux for penetration testing, because of the
            flexibility you have and access to a large ecosystem of
            purpose-built tools. There are trade secrets in every field of
            profession, and whilst I give you what I know here to showcase my
            skills, I would like to add that for each phase, there are many
            other resources that can be used throughout.

                The Network Mapper tool was designed by Gordon Lyon and helps
                penetration testers like us identify flaws within a network. It
                not only reveals information on the network itself but can also
                provide information like open ports or service information that
                can then help security analysts identify where they would need
                to implement enhanced security measures.
                <br /><br />

                The command format or style on nmap looks like the following:
                nmap [IP Address] [ports] [switches]. An example could be nmap
                111.111.111 -p- -sV, which would reveal the service information
                for the ports specified. Of course, the more you use this tool,
                the more methods you learn for using different commands to
                perform different tasks.
                <br /><br />

                Overall, this tool provides insight into a network and its
                devices, which is used to strengthen a system. It’s primarily
                used within the reconnaissance and scanning phases, which help
                pentesters understand what entry points there could be into a
                network and system.

              <p>
                John the Ripper is a password-cracking tool that attempts to
                recover passwords by systematically trying entries from a
                dictionary or precompiled list. This method is particularly
                effective against weak or commonly used passwords. The tool
                often leverages large password databases, including publicly
                available lists, to guide its attempts.<br /><br />

                Using John the Ripper highlights the importance of strong
                password policies and secure storage practices. Modern tools
                like rainbow tables store encrypted versions of passwords
                alongside their plaintext equivalents, allowing testers to
                quickly determine if a password can be derived from its hash.
                This demonstrates how easily weak credentials can be compromised
                if proper safeguards are not in place.<br /><br />

                In penetration testing, John the Ripper is primarily employed
                during the vulnerability assessment phase. It allows testers to
                evaluate the strength of passwords in use, identify weak or
                reused credentials, and provide actionable recommendations to
                improve authentication security, such as enforcing complexity
                requirements or implementing multi-factor authentication.

                Similar to John the Ripper, this tool utilizes a dictionary of
                file types and names to identify hidden directories within a
                server or application. By leveraging this approach, it is
                possible to locate sensitive, valuable, or misconfigured files
                that may require further investigation.<br /><br />

                Directory busters work by sending a large volume of HTTP
                requests to uncover potential paths. For example, files or
                directories may be hidden from search engines using a robots.txt
                file, which instructs crawlers not to index certain paths.
                However, the presence of such files is not eliminated—they can
                still be discovered if the filename is known. This tool enables
                the identification of hidden directories or files so that
                appropriate measures, such as access restriction or improved
                security controls, can be applied.<br /><br />

                Typically, security teams incorporate this tool into routine
                scanning or vulnerability assessments to proactively identify
                and remediate potential risks.

                Website fuzzers operate the same functions as Directory Busters,
                but are performed on a website or application. These allow you
                to find any anomalies that could suggest hidden parameters,
                functionality, or improper input handling.<br /><br />

                A better explanation of this would be to think of having
                implemented a form on your website, which is usually secure.
                With the correct inputs, it could bring back results that
                contain information regarding the backend of your server, which
                then would pose a security flaw, as a hacker could now sit and
                potentially find various ways of entry into your system.<br /><br />

                You’ll usually use this tool during the vulnerability
                assessments and scanning phases, as this is all to do with
                collecting information and resources. This also highlights a
                topic renowned as injection attacks.

                Injection attacks are intrusive in the sense that they are done
                with almost no visibility into the backend of a system, but are
                used to provide detailed information about it. In my experience
                of using tools like SQLmap, you are able to build queries that
                are processed as usual but have malicious intent.<br /><br />

                SQLmap, in particular, looks to perform injection attacks on
                databases that are associated with your website or application.
                It can help someone identify what types of input sanitisation
                methods would be needed to prevent attacks like this from
                happening.<br /><br />

                This type of tool is used during the vulnerability assessment
                and exploit phases, as it is used to not only perform the
                attacks to get into a system by retrieving sensitive
                information, but also allow entry into a system through errors.

                Burp Suite is an application that allows for intercepting,
                analysing, and manipulating web requests in real-time. Think of
                loading your browser and searching for a website on Google,
                which then brings you back results. This is handled as a request
                that is sent with much information included their like a get,
                put, post, or delete request. <br /><br />

                I’m sure that the list of requests above can ignite a brainstorm
                of how requests can be handled by the web. Now, what if we were
                able to stop a request midway through, modify the request type
                and then have that sent to the server? Almost like being in the
                middle of a connection between two users.<br /><br />

                The options available within this tool make it a valuable
                resource to use during scanning and vulnerability assessment
                phases.

                Wireshark is used to analyze packet captures, validate protocol
                behavior, investigate potential data exfiltration paths, and
                gather authoritative network-level evidence. Through detailed
                inspection and annotation of relevant traffic flows, it supports
                technical findings and informs remediation guidance.<br /><br />

                Conceptually, Wireshark decodes captured packets to reveal
                protocol exchanges across multiple network layers. Common
                analysis tasks include isolating conversations between hosts,
                identifying plaintext credential exposure, and verifying the
                presence and integrity of encrypted channels. Typical outputs
                consist of filtered capture segments, annotated protocol
                streams, and timeline visualizations that corroborate
                higher-level assessment results.<br /><br />

                This technique is most often applied during reconnaissance or
                vulnerability assessment phases. The rationale is that packet
                analysis provides low-level confirmation of network behaviors
                and helps validate or contextualize vulnerabilities identified
                at the application or infrastructure level. Portfolio examples
                might describe neutral cases such as extracting and annotating
                protocol streams to demonstrate configuration weaknesses within
                technical appendices.
