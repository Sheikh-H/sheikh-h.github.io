          We all own devices that can access the internet, we browse all day, we
          download files, and click on links to visit sites. How do we know that
          there isn't a connection being made to your device or server without
          authorisation?<br /><br />
          This is where we learn to protect our devices beyond just downloading
          an antivirus software to do the work. If we learn to configure our
          devices in such a manner that is restrictive, we begin to reduce the
          attack surface and strengthen our security.<br /><br />

          <h2>Firewall Configuration</h2>
          <p>
            Setting up your firewall on any platform is relatively easy, but
            it's the functions that a cybersecurity specialist will mostly focus
            on. The reason for this is that firewalls are programs that have
            many features, and by default, all they do is keep a log of incoming
            and outgoing traffic to a server or device. <br /><br />

            However, they need to be instructed on what to block and what not to
            block as online threats become more advanced. As we enter into an
            era of using artificial intelligence for decision-making processes,
            we can begin to visualise how well a firewall program will perform
            using this type of technology, coinciding with modern anti-virus
            software.
            <br /><br />

            Though this is a huge advantage to security analysts, we still need
            to configure our devices in such a manner that helps identify
            threats before they occur and even after an incident. We need to be
            able to identify
            <i>
              where a threat comes from, how it happened and what to do next
              time.</i
            ><br /><br />
            This basic principle allows security analysts to modify a firewall
            to anticipate attacks and prevent them, while also keeping a record
            of all incoming and outgoing traffic. I could go on for a long while
            explaining all the features, types of firewalls, and configuration
            methods, but what would be useful is if I show you some examples of
            what it can do or types of configurations.

          <strong>Windows Firewall</strong><br /><br />
          1. Open the Firewall
          <pre><code>
          Click the Start Menu, type “Windows Defender Firewall”, and open it.
          </code></pre>
          2. Turn It On
          <pre><code>
          In the left panel, click “Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off.”

          Make sure it’s ON for both Private and Public networks.
          </code></pre>
          3. Block Everything by Default
          <pre><code>
          Go back to the main window and click “Advanced settings.”

          In the pop-up, click “Windows Defender Firewall Properties.”

          Under each tab (Domain, Private, Public), set Inbound connections to Block and Outbound connections to Allow.
          </code></pre>
          4. Allow Only What You Need
          <pre><code>
          In the left panel, click “Inbound Rules.”

          On the right, choose “New Rule.”

          Select Port, then Next, choose TCP, and type 80, 443 (for websites).

          Click Next → Allow the connection → Finish.

          Repeat for port 22 if you use SSH (for remote access).
          </code></pre>
          5. Turn on Logging
          <pre><code>
          Still in “Advanced settings,” click “Monitoring → Firewall”.

          Open Properties → Logging tab.

          Turn on “Log dropped packets.”

          This helps you see what the firewall is blocking.
          </code></pre>
          That’s it — your Windows firewall will now allow only web and SSH
          traffic and block everything else.<br /><br />

          <strong>Mac OS</strong><br /><br />

          <p>1. Open Firewall Settings</p>
          <pre><code>
            Click the Apple menu → System Settings → Network → Firewall.
            </code></pre>
          <p>2. Turn It On</p>
          <pre><code>
            Switch the Firewall toggle to ON.
            </code></pre>
          <p>3. Enable Stealth Mode</p>
          <pre><code>
            Click “Options…” (or “Options & Details”).

            Turn on “Stealth Mode.”
            (This hides your computer from unknown network requests.)
            </code></pre>
          <p>4. Allow Only Needed Apps</p>
          <pre><code>
            In the same window, review the list of apps.

            Remove or deny access to apps you don’t need network access for.

            Make sure only your web server, browser, or other necessary tools are allowed.
            </code></pre>
          <p>5. Advanced Users (Optional)</p>
          <pre><code>
            If you want more control, you can use pf (Packet Filter), macOS’s advanced firewall — but for most users, the built-in firewall is enough and much safer to manage.
            </code></pre>
          <p>
            These are some basic configurations and you may want to consult a
            cybersecurity professional to help you navigate around some commands
            and instructions.

          <h2>Apache Hardening</h2>
          <p>
            Running a web server is straightforward, but keeping it secure is
            where the real challenge lies. Apache configuration is key to
            securing and maintaining your web server. Fine-tuning and adjusting
            its settings allows you to restrict network behaviour and protect
            your server from various types of attacks.<br /><br />
            Hardening Apache is a smart decision, and it’s not overly
            complicated to implement. A security analyst can guide you on what
            to look out for and how to safeguard your server effectively.<br /><br />
            It’s important to note that while Apache plays a critical role in
            server security, it is not responsible for input sanitisation. For
            example, consider SQL Injection attacks, where a user might attempt
            to log in using commands like <b>'OR 1=1--'</b>. These attacks
            target the application itself, not the server. However, Apache can
            help mitigate such attacks to some extent when paired with modules
            like <i>mod_security</i>, which can filter and block malicious
            requests before they reach your application.<br /><br />
            As with all areas of cybersecurity, the topic is vast and goes far
            beyond input sanitisation. While some basic checks can be performed
            at the HTML or application level, hardening Apache allows you to
            focus on securing the server itself, reducing the risk of exploits
            and providing a safer environment for your web applications.<br /><br />
            Remember, Apache’s primary role is to deliver your website across a
            network, and its security features are meant to protect the server
            and its communication—not replace proper application-level
            defences.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Keep Apache Updated Always run the latest version to fix security
            issues:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            2. Hide Server Info Stop Apache from showing its version and OS
            details: Edit security.conf and add:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          ServerSignature Off
          ServerTokens Prod
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            3. Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Encrypt traffic with a free Let’s Encrypt
            certificate:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
          sudo certbot --apache
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            4. Disable Directory Listing Prevent visitors from browsing your
            folders: Add this to your site config:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          Options -Indexes
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            5. Add Basic Security Headers Protect against common web attacks:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
          Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
          Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            ✅ Result: Your Apache server is encrypted, hides sensitive info,
            and resists common attacks — all with just a few simple commands.
