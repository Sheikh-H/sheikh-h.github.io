          <h1>Website Builds</h1>
          <p>
            Most of the website builds I have right now only use
            <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> to have it looking and feeling the way
            they do.<br /><br />
            I'm sure you can assume that from the design of my own portfolio
            that I do pay a lot of attention to details when it comes to the
            overall styling and functions.
            <br /><br />
            The problem I find with website builds is that there are so many
            methods to creating one function and thus it takes a lot of practice
            to then learn the different outcomes. One thing is important for
            sure that you do need some level of creativity.

                This website was created during my time at Code Nation as part
                of a design project. While not my best work, I chose to showcase
                it as it highlights how far my design skills have come since
                then. It also wasn’t my first web project, as I had previously
                developed complete systems during my university studies. The
                objective was to create a business concept and design a static
                website to represent it. The site needed to present the company
                to an online audience and include a marketing plan. We were
                given roughly a week to complete the project, so efficiency and
                clear design choices were key. The final product turned out
                quite elegant and demonstrated my growing confidence in layout
                design. Through this build, I learned to use the CSS ‘Grid’
                property, which enables repeating sections within a layout and
                ensures a consistent, well-aligned appearance across the
                website.

              This is a project I am currently working on and is taking some
              time as I juggle with other projects. I hope to make this as a
              full system from designing the backend database and structure all
              the way to placing orders and having order confirmation. Systems
              as large as I am planning to create do take a lot of time and so
              once it is complete I'll be looking at how I can upload it in a
              manner that is best for viewer usablity to allow an insight to the
              backend (admin/staff) and frontend (customer).
